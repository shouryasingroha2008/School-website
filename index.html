            <p class="text-muted text-left">Mount Carmel School (A Christian Minority Institution) is a Senior Secondary School being run under the aegis of Mount Carmel Educational Society, Chandigarh (Regd.), a group of Christian teachers, dedicated to the cause of complete moral, intellectual, Spiritual and social development of boys and girls.
              We derive our inspiration from the Lord Jesus Christ who loves children and we fully believe in the commandment given by Him, ‘Love thy neighbour as thyself’. On this, the motto of our School ‘Amor Vincit Omnia’ is based.
              Mount Carmel School was founded by Dr. Earnest Charles J. Samuel & Dr. Annie Charles Samuel in April 1987</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">Knowledge shall increase in the last days says the Bible. It also says that due to lack of knowledge people perish. How true. We see an explosion of knowledge all over the world today. Technology is advancing at such a pace that the utilities of yesterday have become redundant today. On the other hand the lack of understanding due to illogical use of knowledge has become the cause of destruction of many.</p>

Plans to prosper you not to harm you, plans to give you hope and future.” Jeremiah 29:11. ‘While educating the mind of our youth, we must not forget to educate their heart.’ Today the role of a school is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empowers its students to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers and productive members of an ever changing society.</p>
